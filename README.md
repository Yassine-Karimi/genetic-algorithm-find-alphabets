### 1. Genetic Algorithm Definition

Genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary 
algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying 
on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection .
